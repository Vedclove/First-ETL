# First-ETL

This is a practise ETL miniproject to understand the basics of parsing data and understand the basics of getting the data ready.

I have used python, with pandas library for tasks, like data manipulation in csv, json files. Use of xmltree function to parse data into a dataframe.

Also the time library to maintain a log file for the status of ETL execution.
